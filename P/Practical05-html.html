        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
        displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets 
        (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web
        server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes
        the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the 
        document. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and 
        other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
