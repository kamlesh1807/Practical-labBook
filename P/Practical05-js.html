    JavaScript  often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms
    to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and
    multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation,
    and first-class functions. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies often
    the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web
    applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all major
    web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
